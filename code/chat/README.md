# Chat Functionality Documentation

This document provides an overview of the chat functionality for the Telemedicine Portal application. The chat feature allows users to communicate securely in real-time, enhancing the telemedicine experience.

## Files Overview

- **chat_server.c**: This file contains the server-side code responsible for managing chat connections, handling incoming messages, and broadcasting messages to connected clients.

- **chat_client.c**: This file contains the client-side code that allows users to send and receive messages. It handles user input and displays messages in the chat interface.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Compile the Chat Server and Client**:
   Use a C compiler to compile the server and client files. For example:
   ```
   gcc chat_server.c -o chat_server
   gcc chat_client.c -o chat_client
   ```

2. **Run the Chat Server**:
   Start the chat server in one terminal window:
   ```
   ./chat_server
   ```

3. **Run the Chat Client**:
   Open another terminal window and start the chat client:
   ```
   ./chat_client
   ```

4. **Connect to the Server**:
   Follow the prompts in the client to connect to the chat server and start messaging.

## Usage Details

- Users can send messages to each other in real-time.
- The server handles multiple connections and ensures that messages are delivered to all connected clients.
- Ensure that the server is running before starting the client.

## Security Considerations

- Implement secure communication protocols to protect user data.
- Consider adding user authentication to ensure that only authorized users can access the chat functionality.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement end-to-end encryption for messages.
- Add features such as message history, user presence indicators, and file sharing capabilities.
